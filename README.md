# Project Proposal

## Project Abstract
The virtual Pokémon pet game is a virtual online pokemon collecting game with a focus on raising and caring for your virtual pokemon.  Your pokemon pet will have three status bars, happiness, hunger, and health.  You will have to keep your pet alive and happy through playing with it and feeding it.  You will be able to pick an initial pokemon to raise and expand your collection of pokemon through unlocking and trading.  With your pet you are able to play mini games in order to gain experience points and level it up.  Minigames will include snake, pong, and potentially a couple more.  The game will have a shop where you can buy items such as food and toys using the currency you earned from the minigames.

## Conceptual Design
The Pokemon Pet game will be made entirely only using Java.  The game is basic enough to where it could be completed solely in Java without the need for any game engines.  We will be relying heavily on The Java Swing library since it can provide much of the needed functionality needed for the game such as a Jframe window and button components.  We will also be making use of some basic multithreading to run the game loop and other loops that may need to run continuously while the game is being played.

## Initial Inspirations
Java game projects made using Swing:

## Required Resources
IDE of choice (Intellji, NetBeans, VSCode, etc)
Java SDK

## Personas
### Persona 1 (Written by Michael Ewing)
- Jack, age 8, is a primary school (elementary school) student in Philadelphia, a large tri-state area city in Pennsylvania. He hangs out with kids in his neighborhood around the same age. He was born in the Philly suburbs where his dad works at a law firm and his mom is a remote realtor agent. He is actively looking for the next big activity to do or complete, whether it be reading a new book or just beating the next level in a video game, he’ll find the time to get it done.
- Jack’s experience as a little kid means that he is not very confident with aspects of digital currencies. He may passionately be entertained by the notion of saving up his spare change to buy a new toy, but he doesn't quite understand the math behind the transaction options presented to him. But since he is adequate in other forms of non-arithmetic gaming, he’ll succeed at either snake or pong.

### Persona 2 (Written by Michael Ewing)
- Alex, age 20, is a college student in New York City, a large metropolis in New York state. He hangs out with college friends throughout the town going to shows and bars with people. He was born in upstate New York where his dad worked as a successful artist while his mom built a marketing empire by going on business trips. Alex has always been in a privileged position because of his mom’s power and wealth, with that being said he is fairly hedonistic with his passions. Alex is the type of person to min-max a goal early on and never touch it again afterwards.
- Alex’s experience as a wealthy and experienced adult means that he is confident with aspects of digital currency. He is primarily passionate about keeping his mother’s business going and not diverting from this path that he was given. And as a result he projects that onto the lifestyle choices and habits within the game by min-maxing the amount of money and being efficient with spending it only on food to keep up his pet’s health.

### Persona 3 (Written by Michael Ewing)
- Barbara, age 45, is an active fitness trainer in Los Angeles, a large city in southern California. She hangs out with her similar aged fitness students and goes out to brunch with them often. She was born and raised in Sacramento, California where she would actively take walks in the woods with her parents. Her dad was a local fire-fighter and her mom was an artisan maker in the local town. Barbara may always eat right but she is constantly hydrating herself with whatever comes her way, whether it be an energy drink before a workout or a bottle of water to loosen her body during a light jog.
- Barbara’s experience in staying fit and especially hydrated is key to her behaviors when playing the game. She is constantly gaining currency through mini-games to specifically purchase more water for her pet even if hunger is not on her priorities.

### Persona 4 (Written by Michael Ewing)
- Ethan, age 12, is a secondary school (middle school) student in Scotch Plains, a suburb of northern New Jersey. He hangs out with kids from his middle school classes and his neighborhood friend, Jackson. She was born and raised in Scotch Plains with his dad working as a corporate firm agent taking frequent business trips to Chicago while his mom works as a manager at a local brewery/movie theater. Because of his parents busy schedule, Ethan likes to just fool around the house and just explore every piece of his surroundings even if it means nothing to no one else around him. His personal mindset of having no guidance or objective is what makes him different from everyone else.
- Ethan’s experience in exploration but not really caring about any other objectives besides himself means that he doesn’t care for the minigames or the well being of the pet and just wants to explore the limits of the game given to him. Ethan’s ethos is to break hard and fix later, he doesn’t care and that’s ok.

### Persona 5 (Written by Harsh Patel)
- Sarah is a 25-year-old graphic designer who grew up playing the original Pokémon games on a Gameboy Color. She has a Bachelor's degree in Graphic Design and is tech-savvy, using various software programs to create designs. She is always looking for new and engaging ways to use technology.
- Sarah is excited about the idea of having her own virtual Pokémon and being able to raise and care for it. She is interested in the game's ability to unlock and trade new Pokémon. She enjoys playing mini-games and is looking for a fun way to level up her Pokémon and increase her virtual currency. She wants to connect with other players who share her passion for Pokémon and trading virtual Pokémon with them.
- Sarah's primary goal is to collect and care for a variety of virtual Pokémon. She wants to have a fun and engaging experience while doing so and is looking for a game that offers a variety of features and mini games. She is interested in trading virtual Pokémon with other players and connecting with them through the game's online community. She also wants to use the game as a way to relax and unwind after a long day at work.
